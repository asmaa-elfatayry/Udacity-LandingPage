<h1>landing page project </h1>

- I started by declaring the variable i use :- declare all sections and declare the parent of li =>ul
- second i create function that loop on the elements by the number of sections and create li element and
append the li to ul parent
-call the function
-then loop on all sections to add active class and make element active while i scroll
-add event listener on li when i click on it, it will scroll smoothly for his own section
